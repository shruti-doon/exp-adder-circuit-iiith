1. Firstly learn everything from the 'Demo' section.
2. Then, test your understanding about adder circuits in the 'Pretest' section.
3. Then in the 'Practice' section in the task-1 "Half Adder", make a 1-bit half-adder circuit using logic gates and test it with different inputs. Read the manual page carefully to learn how that can be done.
4. Then, in the task-2 "Full Adder", implement a 1-bit full-adder circuit using logic gates and test it with different inputs.
5. Then, in the task-3 "Ripple Adder", implement a 4-bit ripple carry adder circuit using full adders.
6. Now, test your understanding of the experiment in the 'Posttest' section.
